## Assignment Overview

At this point in the portfolio project, the only thing left as far as
implementation is concerned is the kernel implementation. Therefore, you can
treat this final formative assessment as kernel implementation practice. In
other words, assuming that all the other pieces are in order, your job is to
complete a kernel implementation, just like you've done so many times already.

In keeping with the software sequence discipline, you should create the final
class in the form of `Component#`, where `Component` is the name of your
component and `#` is the number of your implementation. For example, using
NaturalNumber, our kernel implementation might be called `NaturalNumber1L`. Note
that by convention, we use the letter `L` to indicate a "thin" layer over an
existing component. For instance, we might call it `NaturalNumber1L` if the
representation is one of the NaturalNumber classes that already exists in Java.
Alternatively, you are welcome to be more explicit in your naming conventions.
For example, if we implement NaturalNumber on an array, we might call it
`NaturalNumberOnArray`. This more closely mirrors the naming style seen in the
Java Collections Framework, such as `HashSet` vs. `TreeSet`. In any case, the
implementation should have the following form:

```java
public class NaturalNumber1L extends NaturalNumberSecondary {
   ...
}
```

As a reminder, the kernel implementation should only contain implementations
of the kernel and Standard methods. You may also implement the Iterable methods
at this point. Likewise, you will need to define at least one constructor.
Finally, you **must** specify the convention and correspondence at the top
of the file. Feel free to reference any of your kernel implementations for
examples of these.

## Assignment Checklist

<!-- TODO: browse the checklist then delete this comment -->

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Select a reasonable representation for a kernel implementation
2. Provide a representation invariant (i.e., convention) and abstraction
   function (i.e., correspondence) for a kernel implementation
3. Carry out kernel and Standard method implementations as well as constructor
   implementations given a contract, a convention, and a correspondence

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (3 points) In this assignment, you must select a representation for your
   kernel implementation and justify it. Remember that there are a variety of
   reasons for selecting a particular representation, but a good start is to
   choose one that would be easy to work with. Also, remember that part of
   selecting a representation is also explaining which configurations are valid
   and how the representation will be interpreted.
2. (3 points) In the source code, you must provide that actual convention and
   correspondence that you may have discussed below. There is no expectation
   that either the convention or correspondence are written using mathematical
   notation.
3. (4 points) The kernel implementation must have implementations for all kernel
   and Standard methods as well as at least one constructor. Everything you have
   learned this semester about kernel implementations could reasonably be
   assessed here, such as remembering to use a `createNewRep()` method wherever
   a fresh representation is needed or respecting the kernel purity rule.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

> While you're nearing the end of a complete component implementation, there are
> still a few challenging questions to answer. The one we will be focusing on
> right now is the choice of representation. In other words, how do you plan
> to model your component using other data structures? For the first time this
> semester, you will be selecting your own representation, and you will be
> defining your own convention and correspondence for this representation.
> Rather than jumping into the code, take a moment to actually select that
> representation now and justify it. Feel free to also use this space to

> and interpreted (i.e., by correspondence).

<!-- TODO: select a representation and explain why -->

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to create a kernel implementation that
falls from your design up to this point. Since you have done this several times
in the past, there should be no surprises about what goes into a kernel
implementation. However, writing the convention and correspondence is a new
expectation, so take same time to complete the pre-assignment above first.

As with the previous assignments, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your kernel implementation file in `src`, and follow the submission instructions
below.

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

<!-- TODO: update CHANGELOG then delete this comment -->

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed kernel implementation for <!-- insert name of component here --> component

### Updated

- Changed design to include ...

```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

### Submission

<!-- TODO: read the submission instructions then delete this comment -->

Assuming that your project is in a GitHub repo somewhere and your changes are on
a proof-of-concept branch, then what we'll want you to do is create a pull
request of all your changes. Pull requests are pretty easy to make if you're
using GitHub Desktop. Just click the `Branch` tab and select
`Create pull request`. This should pull up your browser with the pull request
form ready to complete. Give your pull request a good title like "Completed Part
5 of the Portfolio Project" and briefly describe what you've done. Then, click
"Create pull request".

If all goes well, you should have a pull request that you can submit to Carmen
via its URL. The URL should be in the form:
`https://github.com/username/repo-name/pull/#`

**Note**: you are the owner of the repo, so you are not required to wait for
feedback before merging. After all, the main purpose of the pull request is to
put all your changes in once place for a code review. However, I highly
recommend keeping the pull request open until at least a peer has had a chance
to look over your changes. Otherwise, you defer needed changes to later pull
requests, which could sacrifice the overall quality of your work or result in
major rework.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component abstract classes for review. Please do not spend a ton of
time on your reviews, **perhaps 10-15 minutes each**. Your job during the peer
review process is to help your peers work through the logic of their implementations
and identify gaps in their use of design-by-contract (i.e., forgetting checks
for preconditions). If something seems wrong to you, it's probably a good hunch,
so make sure to point it out.

When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat them with respect. We
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
