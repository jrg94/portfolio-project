## Assignment Overview

At this point in the portfolio project, the only thing left as far as
implementation is concerned is the kernel implementation. Therefore, you can
treat this final formative assessment as kernel implementation practice. In
other words, assuming that all the other pieces are in order, your job is to
complete a kernel implementation, just like you've done so many times already.

In keeping with the software sequence discipline, you should create the final
class in the form of `Component#`, where `Component` is the name of your
component and `#` is the number of your implementation. For example, using
Point3D, our kernel implementation might be called `Point3D1`. Note that
by convention, we use the letter `L` to indicate a "thin" layer over an existing
component. For instance, we might call it `Point3D1L` if the representation is
one of the point classes that already exists in Java. Alternatively, you are
welcome to be more explicit in your naming conventions. For example, if we
implement Point3D on an array, we might call it `Point3DOnArray`. This more
closely mirrors the naming style seen in the Java Collections Framework, such
as `HashSet` vs. `TreeSet`. In any case, the implementation should have the
following form:

```java
public class Point3D1 extends Point3DSecondary {
   ...
}
```

As a reminder, the kernel implementation should only contain implementations
of the kernel and Standard methods. You may also implement the Iterable methods
at this point. Likewise, you will need to define at least one constructor.
Finally, you **must** specify the convention and correspondence at the top
of the file. Feel free to reference any of your kernel implementations for
examples of these.

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Select a reasonable representation for a kernel implementation
2. Provide a representation invariant (i.e., convention) and abstraction
   function (i.e., correspondence) for a kernel implementation
3. Carry out kernel and Standard method implementations as well as constructor
   implementations given a contract, a convention, and a correspondence

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (3 points) In this assignment, you must select a representation for your
   kernel implementation and justify it. Remember that there are a variety of
   reasons for selecting a particular representation, but a good start is to
   choose one that would be easy to work with. Also, remember that part of
   selecting a representation is also explaining which configurations are valid
   and how the representation will be interpreted.
2. (3 points) In the source code, you must provide that actual convention and
   correspondence that you may have discussed below. There is no expectation
   that either the convention or correspondence are written using mathematical
   notation.
3. (4 points) The kernel implementation must have implementations for all kernel
   and Standard methods as well as at least one constructor. Everything you have
   learned this semester about kernel implementations could reasonably be
   assessed here, such as remembering to use a `createNewRep()` method wherever
   a fresh representation is needed or respecting the kernel purity rule.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

> While you're nearing the end of a complete component implementation, there are
> still a few challenging questions to answer. The one we will be focusing on
> right now is the choice of representation. In other words, how do you plan
> to model your component using other data structures? For the first time this
> semester, you will be selecting your own representation, and you will be
> defining your own convention and correspondence for this representation.
> Rather than jumping into the code, take a moment to actually select that
> representation now and justify it. Feel free to also use this space to
> discuss how that representation will be restricted (i.e., by convention)
> and interpreted (i.e., by correspondence).

<!-- TODO: select a representation and explain why -->

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to create a kernel implementation that
falls from your design up to this point. Since you have done this several times
in the past, there should be no surprises about what goes into a kernel
implementation. However, writing the convention and correspondence is a new
expectation, so take same time to complete the pre-assignment above first.

As with the previous assignments, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your kernel implementation file in `src`, and follow the submission instructions
below.

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that you
convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting.

In addition, the Java file you created should be submitted separately as a PDF.
This template includes the print to PDF extension, so you should be able to
click the print icon in the top right of this panel. In any case, do not copy
the Java code into this file.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component abstract classes for review. Please do not spend a ton of
time on your reviews, **perhaps 10-15 minutes each**. Your job during the peer
review process is to help your peers work through the logic of their implementations
and identify gaps in their use of design-by-contract (i.e., forgetting checks
for preconditions). If something seems wrong to you, it's probably a good hunch,
so make sure to point it out.

When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat them with respect. We
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
