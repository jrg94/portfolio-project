## Assignment Overview

By now, you should have an entire component implemented at all levels. For
example, you should have two interfaces, an abstract class, and a kernel
implementation.

Now, we want you to start producing your actual portfolio. To do that, you
need to do a few things first:

1. **You need to add testing**: tests can be written basically as soon as you
   have designed your interfaces. Of course, because of how many changes your
   design has probably had up to this point, writing tests that early may lead
   to a lot of rework. Therefore, there is no better time to start testing than
   now that you have something more concrete.
2. **You need to share some use cases**: while having an API is useful, it's
   not always clear how and why someone would use it. Therefore, you should
   probably replicate some of the proof-of-concept work you did previously
   using your complete component.
3. **You need to publish your work**: if you haven't yet already, now would
   be a good time to publish your component to a public repo like GitHub.

These are the three main tasks we want you to complete to round out your
portfolio project. However, there are tons of ways to take your work to the next
level, such as:

1. **Publish your documentation**: one of the perks of using JUnit is that you
   can directly convert all those comments you made in your code to HTML
   files that can be hosted as Java documentation. How do you think the OSU
   API works?
2. **Start a CI pipeline**: it's very likely that you won't touch your component
   again after this class. That said, maybe you want to actual publish your
   component to a dependency manager like Maven. If so, it's a good idea to
   setup some automated testing and deployment through "Continuous Integration."
   GitHub Actions is a common tool for this, so why not look into it?
3. **Track version history**: in the world of software development, it's very
   important that you version your API with a version number. There are many
   different techniques for versioning software, but a date-based system is
   pretty easy. If you release your component on a particular date, use that
   date as the version number. Alternatively, you can make use of other
   techniques like semantic versioning.

Many of these additional techniques are somewhat out of the scope of this
course, but just knowing about them could set you up for long term success.

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Design a test plan for a software sequence component
2. Provide example use cases of a software sequence component
3. Use version control software to share a repository of code
4. Reflect on the software development process and the individual's own growth

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (15 points) All component methods must be tested including the Standard,
   kernel, and secondary methods. The format of testing will be different from
   the style used in the course because it is unlikely that you will have an
   existing component to test against (more on this below).
2. (15 points) There must be at least two different sample codes provided that
   show how the component might be used. For example, consider how `XMLTree`
   was used to create the `RSSReader` and the `RSSAggregator`. There is no
   expectation that you provide samples to this much depth, but two files
   with at least a main method would be excellent.
3. (5 points) The complete package (and ideally just the entire portfolio
   project directly) must be committed to some open-source software repository,
   such as GitHub. Appropriate efforts should be made to make the remote
   repository easy to navigate and explore, such as by overwriting the root
   README with details about your project.
4. (15 points) As you work through these finishing touches, take a moment to
   reflect on the software development process. There are reflection prompts
   below. You should also reflect on your growth as a developer and share
   details about what you've learned.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

Now that you have created a software component from scratch, it's time to
reflect on that process as well as take some time to think about your
growth as a developer. Below, you will find a series of reflection prompts.
Take some time to fill them out honestly.

### Software Development

> A common gripe that students express is how much they feel the work they do
> in class fails to map to the real world. Now that you've had a chance to
> complete the portfolio project, how much better (or worse) do you think you
> understand software development and why?

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

> Also, did the portfolio project surface any gaps in your own knowledge of
> software development. If so, what are those gaps and how did you address them?

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

> Finally, as a part of completing the portfolio project, to what extent has
> your perspective of software development changed, if at all? In other words,
> is software development something you still enjoy? If not, why not?

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

### Personal Growth

> One of the challenges of completing the portfolio project is picking up a lot
> of skills on your own. Some of these skills are, of course, software skills.
> However, there are plenty of other skills you may have picked up through
> this process. Therefore, the first question is what skills did you pick up
> through this process?

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

> The follow-up question is: could you rephrase these skills you picked up
> as bullet points that you could put on a resume? Try it below.

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

> Next, how has working on this project affected your career trajectory?
> In other words, do you now hate the topic you picked? Or, are you even more
> interested in it? Both outcomes are valuable to your personal development.

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

> Finally, consider the skills you've picked up and your current career
> trajectory. What are some things you could do to continue on your
> career trajectory? Also, who are some mentors you could contact to help
> you stay on your path?

<!-- TODO: discuss -->

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to polish up your code and get it
ready to publish. To do that, you are being tasked with testing all of your
existing code. You are also being tasked with coming up with at least two
samples of your component being used for something. When all is said and done,
you will publish your component to an open-source repository of your choosing.

### Testing

As a part of testing your code, you will need to create a couple test files
in the `test` directory. One of the files will be the JUnit test file for the
kernel. Meanwhile, the other file will be the JUnit test file for the abstract
class.

Unlike throughout the semester, testing will not involve testing against
a reference implementation. As a result, testing is a bit messier and will
involve calling kernel methods to check state. For example, here is a test
case for one of the getters in Point3D:

```java
@Test
public void testGetXOne() {
    Point3D p = new Point3D1(1, 3, 5);
    assertEquals(1, p.getX(), .0001);
}
```

Note that this kind of testing is not as effective as the reference testing
because it doesn't verify the entirety of the point's state. For example,
it's possible that `p.getX()` somehow changes the state of `p`. By only
verifying the x-coordinate, there's no way of knowing if the remaining
coordinates are still correct. Therefore, it's probably better to write a test
as follows:

```java
@Test
public void testGetXOne() {
    Point3D p = new Point3D1(1, 3, 5);
    Point3D pCopy = new Point3D1(1, 3, 5);
    assertEquals(1, p.getX(), .0001);
    assertEquals(pCopy, p);
}
```

At least that way, you know the point is unchanged (i.e., `getX()` properly
restored `p`).

### Use Cases

Another requirement to finish the project is to provide a couple of use cases
for your component. To do that, the only expectation is that you generate
two Java files in `src` with example code using your component either as part of
the representation of some other proof-of-concept component or directly in
`main`. For instance, the following class would be a extremely minimal example
of how Point3D might be used as part of a representation:

```java
public class Square {

    private Point3D topLeftCorner;
    private Point3D bottomRightCorner;

    public Square(Point3D topLeftCorner, Point3D bottomRightCorner) {
        this.topLeftCorner = topLeftCorner;
        this.bottonRightCorner = bottomRightCorner;
    }

    public double area() {
        double diagonal = this.topLeftCorner.distance(this.topRightCorner);
        return (diagonal * diagonal) / 2;
    }
}
```

### Publishing

Hopefully, you've already been working out of version control software this
entire semester. However, if you have not, the last step would be getting
the project committed to an open-source repository, such as GitHub. Before
submission, I would recommend that your repo looks something like the following:

                    Point3DTest.java
```

There is no correct directory structure, but something like this will make it
easier for others to browse.

At any rate, once you're ready to commit, I would run a `git init` from the
portfolio root. Then, you can make use of whatever tools you want to get the
code to your remote server of choice. For example, you might follow up the
`git init` with a `git add .` and `git commit -m "Finalized my project"`.
At that point, you might use a tool like GitHub desktop to publish the repo
for you to GitHub. Otherwise, you have to do a bit more manual labor. In any
case, I trust that you can figure it out!

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that you
convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting.

Unlike before, there is no requirement that you submit any code in PDFs on
Carmen. Instead, you should submit the URL to the remote repository for your
project. You should also upload the zip of your code alongside the PDF of
this assignment. If you want feedback, your best bet is to use GitHub, so I
can open issues related to your code directly.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component abstract classes for review. Please do not spend a ton of
time on your reviews, **perhaps 10-15 minutes each**. Your job during the peer
review process is to help your peers work through the logic of their implementations
and identify gaps in their use of design-by-contract (i.e., forgetting checks
for preconditions). If something seems wrong to you, it's probably a good hunch,
so make sure to point it out.

When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat them with respect. We
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
