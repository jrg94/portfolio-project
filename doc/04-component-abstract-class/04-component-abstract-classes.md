## Assignment Overview

Now that you've had a chance to refine your designs a bit, it's time to start
writing some code. In this assignment, you will be making your first abstract
class. The abstract class will take on the name `ComponentSecondary`, where
`Component` is the name of your component. For example, if you're making a
NaturalNumber component, the abstract class would be called
`NaturalNumberSecondary` as follows:

```java
public abstract class NaturalNumberSecondary implements NaturalNumber {
   ...
}
```

Inside the abstract class, you will implement every secondary method you
specified in the enhanced interface. Because the secondary abstract class is
layered over the kernel interface, you cannot implement the methods of your
enhanced interface using the underlying representation. As a result, these
methods must be implemented using the kernel methods only.

Surprisingly, you have done this several times before without probably realizing
it. For example, when you first learned recursion in software 1, [you were
tasked with implementing the secondary methods of NaturalNumber][lab-14]. At the
time, they were static methods, but you were tasked with only implementing the
secondary methods using the kernel methods.

You did this a few other times as well. For example, we asked you to
[implement the secondary methods for set at one point][lab-21]. We did this by
having you extend `Set1L`, so you could override the implementation of
`remove()` and `add()`. At the time, we didn't force you to only use kernel
methods, but the premise remains the same. Meanwhile, in a later lab, you were
tasked with implementing the secondary method `sort()` of `Queue`.

Once you have implemented all of the secondary methods, you must also implement
the key `Object` methods. It's up to you to decide which ones you want to
implement, but `toString()` and `equals()` are a great start. You may also
implement `hashCode()` if you so choose. Note that these methods do not have
access to the representation, so you must also implement them using the kernel
methods only.

## Assignment Checklist

<!-- TODO: browse the checklist then delete this comment -->

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Generate a list of changes since the previous iteration of a project
2. Use the kernel and Standard methods to implement a series of secondary
   methods that compile
3. Identify method preconditions and check them appropriately (i.e., follow
   design-by-contract)

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (3 points) In keeping with the concept of iteration, the assignment must
   detail all of the changes from most recent submission (i.e., since the
   interfaces). Make sure to explain what was changed and why.
2. (4 points) The abstract class implementation must implement all methods
   from the enhanced interface (i.e., all secondary methods), and these methods
   must be implemented using only the kernel and Standard methods. In addition,
   the abstract class must implement `toString()` and `equals()`, but you may
   implement `hashCode()` as well. In general, the methods do not have to be
   100% correct, but their logic must make sense (i.e., no low effort
   implementations).
3. (3 points) When implementing the secondary methods, you must respect the
   contracts of the kernel methods. In other words, if a kernel method has a
   precondition, the client of the kernel method must check the precondition.
   If there is no method available to check the precondition, it must be added
   to the kernel.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

> To start making your abstract class, make a branch off of main in your new
> repo called something like `abstract-class`. There are many ways to do this,
> but my preference is to use GitHub Desktop. From there, you can click the
> `Branch` tab, select `New branch`, and name your new branch. Alternatively,
> VSCode has its own GUI for git. You can also make use of the command line
> directly in VSCode to run git commands. It's entirely up to you. Regardless of
> your choice, we'll want a branch that you can later make a pull request from
> with all your changes.
>
> **Note**: because you may have changes still sitting in a pull request,
> you'll want to make this new branch directly from main. This may seem weird
> because you won't be able to see the other parts (e.g., your proof of concept)
> in VSCode. This is okay as parts 1-5 can be executed in isolation and merged
> together later. However, this does mean that you may be waiting for a pull
> request to see if your different features fit together. Once the pull request
> merges, you will need to pull the changes from main into your current branch
> to see them. If you don't like this workflow, you may try following the
> rebase strategies described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35790561/working-while-waiting-for-pending-pr)

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to create an abstract class that falls
from the interfaces you previously designed. Because it is unlikely you have
done this before, consider browsing some examples in the API. Unfortunately,
there are not many. However, you might browse
[SimpleWriterSecondary][simple-writer-secondary] or
[SimpleReaderSecondary][simple-reader-secondary].

As with the previous assignment, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your abstract class file in `src`, and follow the submission instructions below.

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

<!-- TODO: update CHANGELOG then delete this comment -->

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed abstract class for <!-- insert name of component here --> component

### Updated

- Changed design to include ...

```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

### Submission

<!-- TODO: read the submission instructions then delete this comment -->

Assuming that your project is in a GitHub repo somewhere and your changes are on
a proof-of-concept branch, then what we'll want you to do is create a pull
request of all your changes. Pull requests are pretty easy to make if you're
using GitHub Desktop. Just click the `Branch` tab and select
`Create pull request`. This should pull up your browser with the pull request
form ready to complete. Give your pull request a good title like "Completed Part
4 of the Portfolio Project" and briefly describe what you've done. Then, click
"Create pull request".

If all goes well, you should have a pull request that you can submit to Carmen
via its URL. The URL should be in the form:
`https://github.com/username/repo-name/pull/#`

**Note**: you are the owner of the repo, so you are not required to wait for
feedback before merging. After all, the main purpose of the pull request is to
put all your changes in once place for a code review. However, I highly
recommend keeping the pull request open until at least a peer has had a chance
to look over your changes. Otherwise, you defer needed changes to later pull
requests, which could sacrifice the overall quality of your work or result in
major rework.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component abstract classes for review. Please do not spend a ton of
time on your reviews, **perhaps 10-15 minutes each**. Your job during the peer
review process is to help your peers work through the logic of their implementations
and identify gaps in their use of design-by-contract (i.e., forgetting checks
for preconditions). If something seems wrong to you, it's probably a good hunch,
so make sure to point it out.

When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat them with respect. We
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
