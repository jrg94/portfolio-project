# Doc Folder

In general, the purpose of this folder is for storing documentation. For the
purposes of the portfolio project, this folder also holds all of the steps
to completing the project.

In short, there are 6 of these assignments in this folder. The first 5
assignments are intended to be low-stakes assignments for getting feedback on
your designs. The final assignment is where you will submit your completed
component. The score breakdown for all 6 parts is as follows:
