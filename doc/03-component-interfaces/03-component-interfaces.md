## Assignment Overview

By now, you have had the opportunity to create three high-level component
designs and even prove that at least one of them is viable. Hopefully, at this
point, you've also received feedback on your designs. Now, you will have the
opportunity to put together the client-side interfaces, specifically the kernel
and enhanced interfaces.

The kernel interface provides the minimal functionality you would expect of
your data type. By convention, we would name our kernel interface
`ComponentKernel`, where `Component` is the name of your component. As an
example, the kernel interface for the `NaturalNumber` component would be written
as `NaturalNumberKernel`, and it's skeleton would look as follows:

```java
public interface NaturalNumberKernel extends Standard<NaturalNumber> {
   ...
}
```

Similarly, the enhanced interfaces provides all of the methods that we want
to layer on top of the kernel. Again, by convention, we use the name of the
component directly for the enhanced interface. For example, `NaturalNumber`
would be the name of the enhanced interface, and its skeleton would look as
follows:

```java
public interface NaturalNumber extends NaturalNumberKernel {
   ...
}
```

Remember, the interfaces are what the client will see, so you should really be
considering the types of functionality that your user would want. If it helps,
ask yourself the following: what would I (as in you, the reader) want this
component to be able to do? Now that you've had a chance to create a
proof-of-concept, you should be able to answer this question to some extent.

## Assignment Checklist

<!-- TODO: browse the checklist then delete this comment -->

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Identify areas of improvement in previous designs and strategies to address
   them
2. Provide contracts for clients via method headers
3. Assemble a kernel interface in line with the software sequence discipline
4. Assemble an enhanced interface in line with the software sequence discipline

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (2 points) Because these assignments build on each other, it's important
   to acknowledge the growth and development of your work. Therefore, you must
   show what has been changed following the proof-of-concept as it pertains
   to the interface design.
2. (2 points) To ensure you have a conceptual understanding of the kernel
   and enhanced interfaces as well as how they fit in the larger picture,
   you must include a hierarchy diagram for your component.
3. (3 points) Both interfaces must include full documentation for all method
   headers. Documentation must meet the bare minimum expectations for JUnit,
   which means including `@param` for every parameter and `@return` for every
   return type. Documentation must also meet the bare minimum expectations
   for design by contract, which includes an `@ensures` for every method. All
   other aspects of contracts should be included where applicable, such as
   `@requires`, `@replaces`, `@clears`, and `@updates`. There is no requirement
   to use mathematical notation in your contracts.
4. (3 points) The kernel interface must, at the very least, inherit from
   `Standard` and compile. In addition, it must contain a handful of minimally
   viable method headers (i.e., the minimum number of methods needed to model
   the data type). Do not include fields or method implementations. However, you
   may include any nested interfaces needed for your data type. You may also
   include constants that may be helpful throughout the design. Similarly, the
   enhanced interface must, at the very least, inherit from the kernel interface
   and compile. In addition, it may contain as many method headers as you would
   like, but the methods must be able to be implemented by the kernel and
   `Standard` methods. Again, do not include any method implementations or
   fields at this point.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

Before you start crafting your interfaces, you must demonstrate that you know
how everything fits in the discipline hierarchy. You have seen many of these
diagrams already, so you should be able to draw one. Feel free to make a
hierarchy diagram using whatever tools you would like. Then, include a picture
of it in this folder. You may also embed it just below using markdown syntax
(i.e., `[ALT TEXT](path/to/file)`).

<!-- TODO: make a diagram of your component hierarchy then delete this comment -->

To start making your interfaces, make a branch off of main in your new repo
called something like `interfaces`. There are many ways to do this, but my
preference is to use GitHub Desktop. From there, you can click the `Branch`
tab, select `New branch`, and name your new branch. Alternatively, VSCode has
its own GUI for git. You can also make use of the command line directly in
VSCode to run git commands. It's entirely up to you. Regardless of your choice,
we'll want a branch that you can later make a pull request from with all
your changes.

**Note**: because you may have changes still sitting in a pull request,
you'll want to make this new branch directly from main. This may seem weird
because you won't be able to see the other parts (e.g., your proof of concept)
in VSCode. This is okay as parts 1-5 can be executed in isolation and merged
together later. However, this does mean that you may be waiting for a pull
request to see if your different features fit together. Once the pull request
merges, you will need to pull the changes from main into your current branch
to see them. If you don't like this workflow, you may try following the
rebase strategies described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35790561/working-while-waiting-for-pending-pr)
and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18021888/continue-working-on-a-git-branch-after-making-a-pull-request).

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to draft two interfaces in line with
the course discipline: a kernel interface and an enhanced interface. Because it
is unlikely that you've done this before, you may consider browsing some
examples directly from the API. For example, here is the
[NaturalNumberKernel][natural-number-kernel] source code. Your kernel interface
should look something like this. Meanwhile, here is the
[NaturalNumber][natural-number] source code. Similarly, your enhanced interface
should look something like this.

As with the previous assignment, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your two interface files in `src`, and follow the submission instructions below.

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

<!-- TODO: update CHANGELOG then delete this comment -->

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed kernel and enhanced interfaces for <!-- insert name of component here --> component

### Updated

- Changed design to include ...

```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

### Submission

<!-- TODO: read the submission instructions then delete this comment -->

Assuming that your project is in a GitHub repo somewhere and your changes are on
a proof-of-concept branch, then what we'll want you to do is create a pull
request of all your changes. Pull requests are pretty easy to make if you're
using GitHub Desktop. Just click the `Branch` tab and select
`Create pull request`. This should pull up your browser with the pull request
form ready to complete. Give your pull request a good title like "Completed Part
3 of the Portfolio Project" and briefly describe what you've done. Then, click
"Create pull request".

If all goes well, you should have a pull request that you can submit to Carmen
via its URL. The URL should be in the form:
`https://github.com/username/repo-name/pull/#`

**Note**: you are the owner of the repo, so you are not required to wait for
feedback before merging. After all, the main purpose of the pull request is to
put all your changes in once place for a code review. However, I highly
recommend keeping the pull request open until at least a peer has had a chance
to look over your changes. Otherwise, you defer needed changes to later pull
requests, which could sacrifice the overall quality of your work or result in
major rework.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component interfaces assignments for review. Please do not spend a ton
of time on your reviews, **perhaps 10-15 minutes each**. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers edit their contracts. Specifically,
you should be helping them with the readability of their contracts. If something
isn't clear to you, it's probably not clear to others, so help them communicate
their contracts better. When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat
them with respect. We recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure
that your feedback is both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the
markdown as HTML or a PDF to read this rubric as a table).
