## Assignment Overview

By now, you have had the opportunity to create three high-level component
designs and even prove that at least one of them is viable. Hopefully, at this
point, you've also received feedback on your designs. Now, you will have the
opportunity to put together the client-side interfaces, specifically the kernel
and enhanced interfaces.

The kernel interface provides the minimal functionality you would expect of
your data type. By convention, we would name our kernel interface
`ComponentKernel`, where `Component` is the name of your component. As an
example, the kernel interface for the `Point3D` component would be written
as `Point3DKernel`, and it's skeleton would look as follows:

```java
public interface Point3DKernel extends Standard<Point3D> {
   ...
}
```

Similarly, the enhanced interfaces provides all of the methods that we want
to layer on top of the kernel. Again, by convention, we use the name of the
component directly for the enhanced interface. For example, `Point3D` would
be the name of the enhanced interface, and its skeleton would look as follows:

```java
public interface Point3D extends Point3DKernel {
   ...
}
```

Remember, the interfaces are what the client will see, so you should really be
considering the types of functionality that your user would want. If it helps,
ask yourself the following: what would I (as in you, the reader) want this
component to be able to do? Now that you've had a chance to create a
proof-of-concept, you should be able to answer this question to some extent.

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Identify areas of improvement in previous designs and strategies to address
   them
2. Provide contracts for clients via method headers
3. Assemble a kernel interface in line with the software sequence discipline
4. Assemble an enhanced interface in line with the software sequence discipline

## Assignment Rubric

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (2 points) Because these assignments build on each other, it's important
   to acknowledge the growth and development of your work. Therefore, you must
   show what has been changed following the proof-of-concept as it pertains
   to the interface design.
2. (4 points) Both interfaces must include full documentation for all method
   headers. Documentation must meet the bare minimum expectations for JUnit,
   which means including `@param` for every parameter and `@return` for every
   return type. Documentation must also meet the bare minimum expectations
   for design by contract, which includes an `@ensures` for every method. All
   other aspects of contracts should be included where applicable, such as
   `@requires`, `@replaces`, `@clears`, and `@updates`. There is no requirement
   to use mathematical notation in your contracts.
3. (2 points) The kernel interface must, at the very least, inherit from
   `Standard` and compile. In addition, it must contain a handful of minimally
   viable method headers (i.e., the minimum number of methods needed to model
   the data type). Do not include fields or method implementations. However, you
   may include any nested interfaces needed for your data type. You may also
   include constants that may be helpful throughout the design.
4. (2 points) The enhanced interface must, at the very least, inherit from
   the kernel interface and compile. In addition, it may contain as many method
   headers as you would like, but the methods must be able to be implemented by
   the kernel and `Standard` methods. Again, do not include any method
   implementations or fields at this point.

## Pre-Assignment Tasks

> At this point, you should just be writing some code. However, as a part of
> getting into the habit of documenting your work, use this space to document
> any changes you've made to your designs and why.

<!-- TODO: document changes -->

## Assignment Tasks

Your primary task for this assignment is to draft two interfaces in line with
the course discipline: a kernel interface and an enhanced interface. Because it
is unlikely that you've done this before, you may consider browsing some
examples directly from the API. For example, here is the
[NaturalNumberKernel][natural-number-kernel] source code. Your kernel interface
should look something like this. Meanwhile, here is the
[NaturalNumber][natural-number] source code. Similarly, your enhanced interface
should look something like this.

As with the previous assignment, you will share no code here. Instead, create
your two interface files in `src`, and follow the submission instructions below.

## Post-Assignment Tasks

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that you
convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting.

In addition, the Java files you created should be submitted separately as PDFs.
This template includes the print to PDF extension, so you should be able to
click the print icon in the top right of this panel. In any case, do not copy
the Java code into this file.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component interfaces assignments for review. Please do not spend a ton
of time on your reviews, **perhaps 10-15 minutes each**. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers edit their contracts. Specifically,
you should be helping them with the readability of their contracts. If something
isn't clear to you, it's probably not clear to others, so help them communicate
their contracts better. When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat
them with respect. We recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure
that your feedback is both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the
markdown as HTML or a PDF to read this rubric as a table).
