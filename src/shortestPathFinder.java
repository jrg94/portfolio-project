/**
 * A program to manage a graph and determine direct connections between

/**
 * Design Choice:
 *
 * Real-world Relevance: Pathfinding algorithms are crucial in various
 * industries, including automotive for self-driving cars, logistics for
 * warehouse management, and gaming for character navigation. Developing a
 * reliable pathfinding tool offers substantial benefits for automation and
 * efficiency in these sectors. Feasibility: Given the timeframe of a semester,
 * the Pathfind project is feasible because it relies on well-documented
 * algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's, which can be implemented effectively
 * within this period. The project scope is well-defined with clear milestones
 * for developing and testing each algorithm. Personal Interest: This project
 * intersects with my academic goals to deepen my understanding of algorithmic
 * problem-solving and software development. It also offers a hands-on
 * opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, visually
 * demonstrable way. Scalability: The Pathfind project is inherently scalable.
 * Initially focusing on basic 2D grid implementations, it can later expand to
 * more complex scenarios like 3D environments or dynamically changing
 * obstacles, providing a robust platform for continued learning and
 * development. Designer's limitations: The "Pathfind" project is chosen
 * considering my basic algorithm knowledge, limited resources, and time
 * constraints. The approach includes phased learning and using university
 * resources to mitigate these limitations.
